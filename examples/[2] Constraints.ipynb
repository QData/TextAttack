    "# The importance of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints determine which potential adversarial examples are valid inputs to the model. When determining the efficacy of an attack, constraints are everything. After all, an attack that looks very powerful may just be generating nonsense. Or, perhaps more nefariously, an attack may generate a real-looking example that changes the original label of the input. That's why you should always clearly define the *constraints* your adversarial examples must meet. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes of constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "TextAttack evaluates constraints using methods from three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overlap constraints** determine if a perturbation is valid based on character-level analysis. For example, some attacks are constrained by edit distance: a perturbation is only valid if it perturbs some small number of characters (or fewer).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntactic constraints** filter inputs based on their syntax. For example, an attack may require that adversarial perturbations do not introduce grammatical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantic constraints** try to ensure that the perturbation is semantically similar to the original input. For example, we may design a constraint that uses a sentence encoder to encode the original and perturbed inputs, and enforce that the sentence encodings be within some fixed distance of one another. (This is what happens in subclasses of `textattack.constraints.semantics.sentence_encoders`.)"

For whatever reason, the Cactus Road Red Lobster (near Paradise Valley Mall) was dead on a Friday night. It was the first time in a while that when I visited a Red Lobster that a wait to be seated was nonexistent. If there was a wait, I'm sure that the usual lobster tank would have occupied me for a few minutes. As soon as I saw the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp special\" on the menu, I was decided. The shrimp special is no joke. There is a choice of four shrimps including shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, and shrimp with linguini. I'll be the first to admit that Red Lobster seafood isn't Wolfgang Puck Gang quality at the same time that I'll admit that it is far better than frozen foods seafood or a burger served in a casual restaurant chain. It wasn't just the all you can eat shrimp and bottomless soda that makes this a good deal for approximately $20. It was also the salad with dressing and house bread. Red Lobster's menu features many entrees that are affordable. I just happened to hit Red Lobster when they featured the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp.\" If it had been another time of the year, I would have ordered shrimp linguini, which comes with a salad and bread. I had zero complaints about the service. Our Waitress was prompt with the refills at the exact time that she did not rush us. Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone.

       "      <td>Dining in <font color = red>Flushed</font> Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. Going back to 1977, I have been a Red Lobster fan. In my early forties, I continue to be a Red Lobster fan. In 35 years I never got tired of it. So, it is with little surprise that when we visited Phoenix that we would dine in a Red Lobster. For whatever reason, the Cactus Road Red Lobster (near Paradise Valley Mall) was dead on a Friday night. It was the first time in a while that when I visited a Red Lobster that a wait to be seated was nonexistent. If there was a wait, I'm sure that the usual lobster tank would have occupied me for a few minutes. As soon as I saw the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp special\" on the menu, I was decided. The shrimp special is no joke. There is a choice of four shrimps including shrimp scampi, fried shrimp, and shrimp with linguini. I'll be the first to admit that Red Lobster seafood isn't Wolfgang Puck Gang quality at the same time that I'll admit that it is far better than frozen foods seafood or a burger served in a casual restaurant chain. It wasn't just the all you can eat shrimp and bottomless soda that makes this a good deal for approximately $20. It was also the salad with dressing and house bread. Red Lobster's menu features many entrees that are affordable. I just happened to hit Red Lobster when they featured the \"All You Can Eat Shrimp.\" If it had been another time of the year, I would have ordered shrimp linguini, which comes with a salad and bread. I had zero complaints about the service. Our Waitress was prompt with the refills at the exact time that she did not rush us. Dining in Red Lobster is dining in my comfort zone. As long as I am living and have some green in my pocket, I will return to a Red Lobster throughout the year.</td>\n",

There is an undeserved 1-star on here because of lack of 'authenticity' and the fact that they gave the user a fork. <font color = green>Well</font>, guess what--I've been given forks at sushi restaurants that were fantastic. Some people don't know how to eat Ethiopian and that's fine. One thing you should definitely do is read the blurb on the front of the menu. Not only is it really interesting (the restaurant is actually named after an ancient church that was excavated) but it gives you helpful background on what you're about to get in to. Like other users note, injera (en-jee-rah) is weird. Looks like a sponge, feels like rubber, tastes like a sour sock. So, you get why Ethiopians eat it smothered in stuffs. Luckily, the stuffs are hella tasty, and vegetarian/vegan friendly. I'd recommend the spicy stuff (No. 9 was my favorite) but anything cold can get kind of odd. Lots of lentils are served here, and you can even buy the Lalibela brand at Whole Foods. What else can I say, the service was awesome, the food was unique and reasonably priced. If it's between you and one other person I'd probably only get three entrees, they are pretty big despite what the server will probably say. I didn't give five stars because I've only been once. Try it out soon.</td>\n",

Cool <font color = green>Cuts</font> has a nice play area for kids while they wait including video game stations for the older kids. A basic cut is $16.95 which is average. You can find cheaper prices at Stupidcuts and Hateclips, but you will make up the difference by waiting at least an hour for a moron to cut your child's hair badly, and your child being scared to death in the process. Spend a few bucks more and go to a shop that specializes in kids. The kids get to sit in a regular chair or a special car or airplane chair and watch a video from a decent selection while the snippers do their work. My little boy just had his third haircut ever, and Maryam (sic) did a great job. I think she set the land speed record for cutting hair. He was seated and done within 5 minutes, and all that while having a screaming fit the way only an 18 month old boy from my family can do. They will use scissors if the child can stand it, and clippers if she has a squirmer. I recommend calling ahead for a reservation or you will have to wait (or shop with your wife while waiting!).</td>\n",

We watch Hells Kitchen so we knew it existed. It is within the Cesar's palace. <font color = red>Nice</font> decor. I ordered a burger, nothing fancy. It took more than one hour for my girlfriend and I to get our food. THe waitress disappeared for more than 45 min, when she finally came back she was worried that we did not get our food yet, eventually the manager came to apologize as well and to offer us a round of drink assuring that food was on its way. Another 15-20 min later, we finally got our order, it looked great however my patty was not cooked... simply grilled on the outside and raw on the inside, it was funny to see that considering the show that Gordon puts on in Hells Kitchen over uncooked meat... I mentioned to the waitress and the manager who did not charge us for my dish. They offered to order a new one but at this point the quick lunch turned into a 2 hours bad experience and we wanted to get out. I think the staff handled the situation properly, some might have yelled a little more and maybe ask for more comps... This was certainly a bad experience overall, I am sure however it does not reflect the standards of the restaurant... I hope. but with so many other places in Vegas I doubt I will give it another shot.... I give two stars for the staff's reaction, even slow, at least they tried to do something... and for the beer I was drinking that I thought was great !</td>\n",

However, we can see some problems inherent in the detector: it often thinks the first word of a given sentence is a named entity, probably due to capitalization. (This is why \"Awesome atmosphere\" can be replaced by \"Sublime atmosphere\" and still fulfill our constraint; NLTK is telling us that both of those are proper nouns, some specific named type of atmosphere.) \n",
