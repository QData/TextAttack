    BAE: BERT-based Adversarial Examples for Text Classification.

    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01970

    This is "attack mode" 1 from the paper, BAE-R, word replacement.

    We present 4 attack modes for BAE based on the
        R and I operations, where for each token t in S:
        • BAE-R: Replace token t (See Algorithm 1)
        • BAE-I: Insert a token to the left or right of t
        • BAE-R/I: Either replace token t or insert a
        token to the left or right of t
        • BAE-R+I: First replace token t, then insert a
        token to the left or right of t

        # means of masking a part of the input and using a LM to fill in the mask."

        # constant) predicted by BERT-MLM using a Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)
        # (Cer et al., 2018)-based sentence similarity scorer."

        # embeddings of the adversarial and input text."

        # [from email correspondence with the author]
        # "For a fair comparison of the benefits of using a BERT-MLM in our paper,
        # we retained the majority of TextFooler's specifications. Thus we:
        # 1. Use the USE for comparison within a window of size 15 around the word
        # being replaced/inserted.
        # 2. Set the similarity score threshold to 0.1 for inputs shorter than the
        # window size (this translates roughly to almost always accepting the new text).
        # 3. Perform the USE similarity thresholding of 0.8 with respect to the text
        # just before the replacement/insertion and not the original text (For
        # example: at the 3rd R/I operation, we compute the USE score on a window
        # of size 15 of the text obtained after the first 2 R/I operations and not
        # the original text).
        # ...
        # To address point (3) from above, compare the USE with the original text
        # at each iteration instead of the current one (While doing this change
        # for the R-operation is trivial, doing it for the I-operation with the
        # window based USE comparison might be more involved)."
        #
        # Finally, since the BAE code is based on the TextFooler code, we need to
        # adjust the threshold to account for the missing / pi in the cosine
        # similarity comparison. So the final threshold is 1 - (1 - 0.8) / pi
