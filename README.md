# For developers

## Installation
1. Create a new conda environment with python 3.8:

```$ conda create -n <env_name> python=3.8```

```$ conda activate <env_name>```

```(<env_name>) $ pip install git+https://github.com/kjohnson3595/TextAttackHMC22-23.git@development```

2. To run our interactive command line interface, run the following command:
```$ euclids interactive```


# Contributing

## Installation
1. Clone the source repository: 

```$ git clone git@github.com:kjohnson3595/TextAttackHMC22-23.git```

2. Install all runtime and development dependencies in a new conda env:

```$ conda create -f env.yml```

```$ conda activate t4a```

3. Install the eukaryote package:

```$ pip install -e .```

## Running tests
Tests will run by default every time you push code to a new branch (for now). Before pushing, it's generally a good idea to run the tests on your own machine.
If you aren't working on code coverage and just want to run tests, run the following command:

```$ pytest tests -v```

If you want to assess test coverage, run the following commands:

```$ coverage run -m pytest tests```

```$ coverage report -m``` (this will print a nice report of per-file and overall code coverage)
