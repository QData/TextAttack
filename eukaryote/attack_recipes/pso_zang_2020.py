    Methodology description quoted from the paper:

    "We propose a novel word substitution-based textual attack model, which reforms
    both the aforementioned two steps. In the first step, we adopt a sememe-based word
    substitution strategy, which can generate more candidate adversarial examples with
    better semantic preservation. In the second step, we utilize particle swarm optimization
    (Eberhart and Kennedy, 1995) as the adversarial example searching algorithm."

    And "Following the settings in Alzantot et al. (2018), we set the max iteration time G to 20."
