Description: # TextAttack
        
        ## Installation
        
        You must be running Python 3.6+ to use this package. A CUDA-compatible GPU is 
        optional but will greatly improve code speed.
        
        ```
        conda create -n text-attack python=3.7
        conda activate text-attack
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        We use the list of stopwords from nltk. To download them run in Python shell:
        
        ```
        import nltk
        nltk.download('stopwords')
        ```
        
        ### Common Errors
        
        #### Errors regarding GCC
        If you see an error that GCC is incompatible, make sure your system has an up-to-date version of the GCC compiler. On distributed systems with a `module` system, typing `module load gcc` may be sufficient.
        
        #### Errors regarding Java
        Using the LanguageTool constraint relies on Java 8 internally (it's not ideal, we know). Please install Java 8 if you're interested in using the LanguageTool grammaticality constraint. If your system has the `module` command, try typing `module load java8`.
        
        ## Features
        
        ### Models
        
        We've also included a few pre-trained models for common
        tasks that you can download and run out-of-the-box. However,
        anything that overrides __call__, takes in tokenized text, and 
        outputs probabilities works for us. This includes your favorite
        models in both Pytorch and Tensorflow.
        
        @TODO show examples of each in `examples/`.
        
        ### Attack Methods
        
        We support the following attack methods:
        
        - Greedy selection over all input words
        - Greedy selection with Word Importance Ranking (["Is Bert Really Robust?" (Jin et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11932))
        - Genetic algorithm (["Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples" (Alzantot et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07998))
        
        ### Perturbations
        
        An attack method selects the best possible perturbation from a set of potential perturbations. We support perturbations on the sentence, word, and character level.
        
        
        #### Word Perturbations
        
        - Counterfit synonym swap
        
        ### Constraints
        
        Text input perturbations are only valid if they meet the constraints of the attack. This library supports constraints on the semantic, syntactic, and morphological level. Some constraints measure changes in the entire input, while others only take into account substitutions of a single word.
        
        #### Semantics
        - Word embedding nearest-neighbor distance
        
        #### Syntax
        - Grammatical errors induced, measured with [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)
        
        #### Morphology
        
        ### Datasets
        
        We include a few popular datasets to get you started.
        
        #### Yelp Sentiment Analysis
        
        The [Yelp Sentiment Analysis dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge) includes inputs from yelp reviews manually labeled as positive (1) or negative (0).
