Search Methods API Reference
============================

:class:`~textattack.search_methods.SearchMethod` attempts to find the optimal set of perturbations that will produce an adversarial example.
Finding such optimal perturbations becomes a combinatorial optimization problem, and search methods are typically heuristic search algorithms designed
to solve the underlying combinatorial problem.

More in-depth study of search algorithms for NLP adversarial attacks can be found in the following work 
`Searching for a Search Method: Benchmarking Search Algorithms for Generating NLP Adversarial Examples <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06368>`_
by Jin Yong Yoo, John X. Morris, Eli Lifland, and Yanjun Qi.
