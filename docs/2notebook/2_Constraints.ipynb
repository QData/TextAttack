    "Constraints determine which potential adversarial examples are valid inputs to the model. When determining the efficacy of an attack, constraints are everything. After all, an attack that looks very powerful may just be generating nonsense. Or, perhaps more nefariously, an attack may generate a real-looking example that changes the original label of the input. That's why you should always clearly define the *constraints* your adversarial examples must meet. "

For example, we may design a constraint that uses a sentence encoder to encode the original and perturbed inputs, and enforce that the sentence encodings be within some fixed distance of one another.
