        "1.  **transformation**: all [transformations](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc/textattack.transformations.html) implemented by TextAttack can be used to create an `Augmenter`. Note here that if we want to apply multiple transformations in the same time, they first need to be incooporated into a `CompositeTransformation` class.\n",
        "2.  **constraints**: [constraints](https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc/textattack.constraints.html#) determine whether or not a given augmentation is valid, consequently enhancing the quality of the augmentations. The default augmenter does not have any constraints but contraints can be supplied as a list to the Augmenter.\n",
        "3.  **pct_words_to_swap**:  percentage of words to swap per augmented example. The default is set to 0.1 (10%).\n",
        "4.  **transformations_per_example** maximum number of augmentations per input. The default is set to 1 (one augmented sentence given one original input)\n",

        "An example of creating one's own augmenter is shown below. In this case, we are creating an augmenter with **RandomCharacterDeletion** and **WordSwapQWERTY** transformations, **RepeatModification** and **StopWordModification** constraints. A maximum of **50%** of the words could be purturbed, and 10 augmentations will be generated from each input sentence.\n"
